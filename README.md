TODO:
    Need to add a global list of machines. Issue right now is that the machines have to be
    put under a betting area. If removed from a betting area, say placed up in the shop for
    work to be done, there is no way of keeping track of them.
    May need to simply unbind the betting area value from the machine and rebind off a master list.
